In this activity, you'll review a scenario, and apply data visualizations with ggplot2. You will learn aesthetic features of visualizations and how to customize them by specific criteria. 

## The Scenario
In this example, you are a junior data analyst working for the same hotel booking company from earlier. Last time, you created some simple visualizations with `ggplot2` to give your stakeholders quick insights into your data. Now, you are are interested in creating visualizations that highlight different aspects of the data to present to your stakeholder. 

## Aesthetics in ggplot2
There are three basic aesthetic attributes to consider when creating ggplot2 visualizations in R: `color`, `size`, and `shape`.

An `aesthetic` is defined as a visual property of an object in your plot. 

Basic aesthetic attributes in ggplot2:

- `Color:` this allows you to change the color of all of the points on your plot, or the color of each data group
- `Size:` this allows you to change the size of the points on your plot by data group
- `Shape:` this allows you to change the shape of the points on your plot by data group

An example of how aesthetic attributes are displayed in R:

```r
ggplot(data, aes(x=distance, y= dep_delay, color=carrier, size=air_time, shape = carrier)) +
      geom_point()
```

## Geom Functions
In ggplot2, a geom is the geometrical object used to represent your data. Geoms include `points`, `bars`, `lines`, and more.

There are tons of geoms out there. Just pick one that fits how you wanna show your data and who you're talking to. This way, you can share your data story in various ways and make it work for different people.

- `geom_point:` uses points to create scatter plots.  
- `geom_ bar:` uses bars to create bar charts. We didn't supply a variable for the y-axis. R automatically counts how many times each x-value appears in the data, and then shows the counts on the y-axis.
- `geom_line:` connects observations, ordered by x value. 
- `geom_smooth:` adds a trend line over an existing plot.
- `geom_jitter:` creates a scatter plot and then adds a small amount of random noise to each point in the plot. Jittering helps us deal with over-plotting, which happens when the data points in a plot overlap with each other. Jittering makes the points easier to find.

## Making a Bar Chart

`Example` bar chart: 

```r
ggplot(data = hotel_bookings) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = distribution_channel))
```

## Diving deeper into bar charts

After exploring your bar chart, your stakeholder has more questions. Now they want to know if the number of bookings for each distribution type is different depending on whether or not there was a deposit or what market segment they represent. 

Try running the code below to answer the question about deposits. You will use `'fill=deposit_type'` to accomplish this.

```r
ggplot(data = hotel_bookings) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = distribution_channel, fill=deposit_type))
```

Now try running the code below to answer the question about different market segments. You will use 'fill=market_segment' to accomplish this.

```r
ggplot(data = hotel_bookings) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = distribution_channel, fill=market_segment))
```

## Facets Functions
`Facet` functions help show off smaller chunks or subsets of your data. Think of a facet like the side of a gemstone â€“ each one displays a different aspect of your data by giving each subset its own little plot. Faceting is awesome for uncovering new patterns and zeroing in on how different variables relate to each other.

Two types of facets: 
- `facet_wrap:`facet your plot by a single variable. 
- `facet_grid:`facet your plot by variables which form the rows and columns.
- `'~':` tilde symbol used before variables.

After reviewing the new charts, your stakeholder asks you to create separate charts for each deposit type and market segment to help them understand the differences more clearly.

A different chart for each deposit type:
```r
ggplot(data = hotel_bookings) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = distribution_channel)) +
  facet_wrap(~deposit_type)
```

A different chart for each market segment:
```r
ggplot(data = hotel_bookings) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = distribution_channel)) +
  facet_wrap(~market_segment)
```

The `facet_grid` function does something similar. The main difference is that `facet_grid` will include plots even if they are empty. 

`Example:`

```r
ggplot(data = hotel_bookings) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = distribution_channel)) +
  facet_grid(~deposit_type)
```

Now, you could put all of this in one chart and explore the differences by deposit type and market segment.

Notice how the ~ character is being used before the variables that the chart is being split by: 

```r
ggplot(data = hotel_bookings) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = distribution_channel)) +
  facet_wrap(~deposit_type~market_segment)
```

## Smoothing 

`Smoothing` in ggplot2 is super handy for making your R data visuals clearer and simpler to follow. Scatter plots can sometimes be tricky to grasp, but smoothing helps reveal trends that might be tough to spot just by looking at the points. Ggplot2's smoothing feature adds a smooth line to your plot, making it easier for anyone to get the gist of your data.

`Example:`
```r
ggplot(data, aes(x=distance, 
y= dep_delay)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth()
```

Two types of smoothing: 
- `Loess smoothing:`The loess smoothing process is best for smoothing plots with less than 1000 points.
```r
ggplot(data, aes(x=, y=))+ 
  geom_point() +       
  geom_smooth(method="loess")
```
- `Gam smoothing:`Gam smoothing, or generalized additive model smoothing, is useful for smoothing plots with a large number of points. 
```r
ggplot(data, aes(x=, y=)) + 
  geom_point() +        
  geom_smooth(method="gam", 
formula = y ~s(x))
```
Smoothing in ggplot2 takes your data plots up a notch, making it simpler to spot trends and gain valuable insights. Check out the first plot below, which shows the raw data, and then take a look at the second plot that has the same data but with smoothing applied.
